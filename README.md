# Movie-Recommendation-System

Welcome to a Movie Recommendation System! This program lets you filter and search through movies depending on their relative scores based on ratings, similarity and how other people liked it as well. This project was done in Jupyter Notebooks and an interactive Jupyter textbox widget is used to search for movies you want, the recommendation system provides a score based on how others liked the movie you're searching for as well.
